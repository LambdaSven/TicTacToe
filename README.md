# TicTacToe

This was the take-home final exam for High Quality Software Programming at Conestoga College.

This is a GUI-Based Tic Tac Toe game, with a full AI and save/load functionality.

The AI generates the game tree from a given position, and uses Minimax to determine the optimal move. 

The GUI is does using the MVVM model, with caliburn micro as a library to facilite convienent data binding.

The Saves are XML files, as was specified by the exam format, and are saved in a folder in the same directory as the project. If I were to make this again I would use AppData
But the specification of the exam was clear.
